# AdventOfCode24

At the side of my regular job I've been trying to get to know programming better especially in system languages.
Since I'm not in any way a developer I'm just going to try things and add them to my github. If you want a clever or good solution this is not it my friend!

I see it as practice and getting to know the standard library of C++, I might even do it in another language.
